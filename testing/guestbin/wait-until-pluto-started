# Wait until both whack can talk to pluto and the addconn process has
# has finished adding connections, i.e., until pluto has started.

# When pluto starts it does:
#
# - creates whack socket
#   -> whack requests will block
# - vfork() then exec(addconn)
#   -> addconn is added to pluto's process list
# - starts event loop
#   -> (blocked) whack requests will be processed
#
# This code checks things in reverse:
#
# - queries pluto for a process list
#   -> so it waits until the event loop is running
#      and addconn has been started
# - checks the process list for addconn
#   -> so it waits until addconn has finished
