Usage:

    $0 <repodir> <gitrev>

Where <repodir> defaults to the current directory.  XXX: The parameter
order needs to be reversed.

Examine <gitrev> in <repodir> and determine if it is sufficiently
"interesting" to be worth testing.

The output is one of:

    tag: <tagname>
    	a commit containing a tag
    merge: <parents>
        a merge point
    branch: <children>
        a branch point
    true
        a commit that changes build and/or source files
    false
        the commit is not interesting

EOF
    exit 1
fi
