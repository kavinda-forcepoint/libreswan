Test for NAT-t with %priv,%no when there is no NAT and "public ip" is in exclude list.

This tests for the common deployment where a remote host cannot use the enterprise IP range
as their own NAT range. so the server has a virtual-private %exclude to drop these.
But if the road warriors then connects from inside the enterprise, there is no NAT but
it WILL use the IP that is in %exclude but it should not trigger the block because there
is no NAT.
